## Configurations inherited from Kafka clients
The following configurations are inherited from the open source Kafka client configurations. They will be used by all the clients in Cruise Control to communicate with the Kafka cluster.

|----------------------|--------|-----------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| capacity.config.file | String | Y         | config/capacityJBOD.json  | The path to the configuration JSON file that provides the capacity of the brokers. |

#### Populating the Capacity Config File

`Overview:` Broker capacity resolution is handled by a pluggable component.
The default capacity resolver implementation requires users to manually populate a capacity file with broker capacities.
If users have access to an external resolver for broker capacities, they can also customize their resolver to use this 
source for the capacity information. The rest of this section describes how to use one of these options.

`Option-1 (default)`: The following steps allow users to set the initial broker capacities or update capacities upon addition of 
new brokers out-of-the-box:
1. Check `cruisecontrol.properties` file to verify that the `capacity.config.file` config points to the file you are modifying.
By default, this config is set to use `config/capacityJBOD.json`. If you have 
    * a non-JBOD deployment, where each broker has the same number of cores, you may use `config/capacity.json`, or
    * a non-JBOD deployment, where brokers may have varying number of cores, you may use `config/capacityCores.json`
 and modify this file.
2. Ensure that the capacity file picked in `step-1` contains either a default capacity for missing broker ids, or 
explicitly specifies capacities for brokers with specific ids provided by user.
3. Finally, bounce your Cruise Control instance.

`Option-2 (implement your own resolver)`: `BrokerCapacityConfigResolver` is a pluggable component. Hence, you can write your own pluggable capacity 
resolver to dynamically resolve the broker capacities if you have a source to provide the capacity information. 
Using this approach, you may avoid restarting your CC instance upon a (1) capacity change or (2) addition of a broker 
with a non-default capacity. See:
1. [The relevant interface](https://github.com/linkedin/cruise-control/blob/master/cruise-control/src/main/java/com/linkedin/kafka/cruisecontrol/config/BrokerCapacityConfigResolver.java),
2. Its default implementation by [BrokerCapacityConfigFileResolver](https://github.com/linkedin/cruise-control/blob/master/cruise-control/src/main/java/com/linkedin/kafka/cruisecontrol/config/BrokerCapacityConfigFileResolver.java), and 
3. The [relevant configuration](https://github.com/linkedin/cruise-control/blob/master/cruise-control/src/main/java/com/linkedin/kafka/cruisecontrol/config/constants/MonitorConfig.java#L294) to set the config resolver to be used.

Besides the above configurations, CruiseControlMetricsReporter takes all the configurations for vanilla KafkaProducer with a prefix of "cruise.control.metrics.reporter."

##Resolving environment variables as config values
It is often required to resolve an environment variable as a config value. Such case is when a password is set by the environment to avoid putting them into config files.

For instance the following config will resolve the `SSL_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` environment variable and set its value as the actual value of the `webserver.ssl.keystore.password` config:

`webserver.ssl.keystore.password=${env:SSL_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD}`
